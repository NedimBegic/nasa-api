# nasa-api
This site is created using NASA'api where the user can type a date and get the photo and the description of that day. The site is only for learning
procces and the main goal is to see api's in action. I personaly like the earth and the astronaut animation behind it.
Also the website is live so you can check it out on: https://my-nasa-api.netlify.app/
